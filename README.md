# Leetcode User Scraper

Scraping user data from leetcode contest rankings. 



## Tech Stack

Python, Selenium, Beautiful Soup


## Installation

Simply clone on replit.com

```bash
  Run main.py
```
    
## Too Slow?

Replit free tier has limits - 
To bypass that, you can clone this "repl" into upto 15 repls and run them simultaneously. 

You can change this code:

start_page = 1
end_page = 100

to give different start and end page to different repls to make scraping faster by running 15 repls in parallel.
